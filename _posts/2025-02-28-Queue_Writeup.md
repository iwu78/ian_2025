This is a writeup of the Queue feature.

## Purpose
Too often, in class we line up to go up to present. This results in long lines of unproductivity. To solve this, the Queue feature can be used.
<br>
This feature is designed to
- Allow people to stay at their seats while they are waiting to go up and continue working.
- Organize what order so people do not rush and fight to present
- Allow the teacher to keep track of who has and has not gone
<br>

#### Teacher
1. Navigate to the following link for the teacher management site: [LINK](https://spring2025.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/mvc/assignments/queue-management)
