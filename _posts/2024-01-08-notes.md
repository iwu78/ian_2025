Do not make a summary. -Comment from teacher

 - Takeaway
    - Note 1
    - Note 2
    - Application

 - Throughout rest of education, especially college, code functioning is worth relatively little in points 
    - Main grading comes from demonstrating knowledge of code to reviewer
    - Much like live reviews in class, demonstration of knowledge is more important than "finishing" product
    - Application to project: focus not on finishing feature, but reducing bugs and identifying where things can be improved, then repeat
 - Presenting material clearly and concisely is effective in conveying information seriously, keeping reviews concise
    - Short and to the point is much better than unnecessary talk, as long as work and understanding is conveyed
    - Application: In team projects, especially big class wide project, must return to and use agile methodology, will streamline organization and in turn presentation

 - Documentation i.e. issues, flowchart: makes things easier to understand and more presentable to reviewers
    - Comments: taught with large project and other people needing to understand your code. Commentless code means more work to explain and debug later
    - Comments help understand logic behind code. Useful for others to spot errors, as well as solving bugs and expanding upon code later
    - Application to project: comment more. recomment in places where comments are little and write in a way that encourages other people to review
    - Application to project: flowchart, consider tools such as draw.io in order display thought process and code
    - Communication through documentation conveys understanding, as mentioned above may be more important than code itself
 - Website creation in class continued through and helped in college
    - Reminder: Update personal blog and merge creations
