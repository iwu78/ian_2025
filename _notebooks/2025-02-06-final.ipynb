    "My Feature: Queue\n",
    "Status before trimester began:\n",
    "- Feature was not deployed\n",
    "- All control, including teacher were on one page\n",
    "- Disorganized system of storing queues\n",
    "- Backend did not store anything other than queue\n",

    "1. Made queue usable on a deployed site <br>\n",
    "- Any controls used by teacher were moved to a page on spring. Frontend features were limited to add and remove from queue.\n",
    "- Queue is stored as table, uses converter to convert to JSON\n",
    "- Queue automatically updates, no need to refresh\n",
    "- Created a modal to connect to assignment\n",

    "- Sometimes, need to take a step back and delegate work, letting others do and learn\n",

    "N@tM was a successful presentation. Me and Jon presented our projects to teachers, parents and students, and received feedback. Some of this feedback was minor fixes such as a centering issue that I didn't notice, but the biggest piece was that there should be a button if you would like to end your presentation early. This was reflected by several parents and several teachers (i.e. Mr. Askegreen).\n",

This project stood for me because of an interest in National Parks. Gave some recommendations, such as storing national park data on backend in addition to comment and review data.\n",
